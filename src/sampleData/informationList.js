    "Inland area: 330,991 Km2<br/>Length: 1,650 Km<br/>Width: 600 km at the widest point and 50 km at the narrowest point.",
  geographical_situation:
    "Located on the eastern coast of South-East Asian Indochinese Peninsula, Vietnam shares its borders with Cambodia and Laos to the West, with China to the North and the East Sea to the East. Total coastline and borders stretch 2,500 Km. An estimated 66% of the total area is dominated by the rugged, heavily forested terrain of the Truong Son Range stretching North-South between the intensively cultivated and densely populated Red River (North) and the Mekong River (South) deltas. The highest peak in Vietnam is Fan Si Pan (3,143 m) in the extreme North. A long, narrow coastal plain links the two major river deltas. 22% of the land is arable and 40% is forested.",
  population:
    "Vietnam has 84, 2 million inhabitants with an average density of 250 inhabitants/km2.<br/>88% of the population is Viet, 2% Chinese and 1.5% Khmer. Numerous ethnic minorities make up the rest of the population of Vietnam: Muong, Nung, Dao, Thai, Cham, Hmong and various mountain-dwellers.<br/>The dominant religions are Buddhism (55% of the population) and Catholicism (8% to 10% of the population). Confucianism, Taoism, Hoa Hao, Islam and Caodaism represent around 35% of the population.",
  language:
    "Vietnamese is the official language although English is increasingly spoken by younger Vietnamese in main cities. Some people and especially elderly still speak French, while middle-aged might speak German and Russian. However a guide is duly recommended as language can be a problem outside of main cities for people who have no knowledge of Vietnamese.",
  currency:
    "The official currency is the Vietnamese Dong (VND) although US dollars and Euros are still accepted. At the time of writing exchange rate is US$ 1 = 23,421 VND (May 2020).<br/>Traveler’s cheques can be cashed only at major banks and usually incur a 2 to 5% transaction fee.<br/>Most of hotels, restaurants and shops in tourist cities of Vietnam accept Visa and Master cards, but can also be subject to 2 to 3% transaction fees.<br/>You can also get cash advances with your credit card from automated teller machines (ATM) everywhere (amount generally limited to 5 or 10.000.000 VND, that is to say around 230 USD to 450 USD depending on the bank).<br/>If you bring either cash in USD or Euro, please note that exchange rates for small and big notes vary. So we would recommend you to bring some small notes in USD dollars to cope with first expenses on arrival then either 100 USD or 100 € bank notes.<br/>Be careful, banks and foreign exchange offices do not usually take old, scribbled or even stained bank notes.",

    "Due to its long shape bordering the South East Sea, Vietnam has a much diversified weather and climate so visitors can come to Vietnam all year round without having many climatic disadvantages.",

  telecommunications:
    "International phone call charges from Vietnam have decreased tremendously over the past few years. Today, the cost of an international phone call is 0,75 USD/minute for Europe.

However, some hotels may charge Wi-Fi connection.",
  health_n_medical:
    "No vaccination is required, but visitors are advised to receive inoculations against hepatitis A and B, typhoid and tetanus. Inoculation for yellow fever and tablets for malaria are not necessary although doctors still usually recommend them.<br/>Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City have good hospitals staffed with foreign medical personnel. However for life threatening injuries it can be necessary to be evacuated to Bangkok or Singapore and we therefore strongly recommend medical travel insurance.",
  transportation:
    "There are five international airports in Vietnam: Noi Bai in Hanoi located 45 minutes from the town centre, Cat Bi in Hai Phong, Danang’s airport at 4 km from the heart of the town, Cam Rang located 40 mn driver from Nha Trang and Tan Son Nhat in Ho Chi Minh City located 20 minutes from the town centre.<br/>The road network has improved but still needs to be upgraded in some areas. To cover a distance, it is reasonable to count an average speed of 50 km / hour.<br/>By train, it takes a minimum of 32 hours from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City. Although we can now find carriages with soft sleepers and air-conditioning, it is rather slow and not particularly comfortable but for a short journey, it is an interesting way to see Vietnam.<br/>Helicopter sightseeing has become available using safe helicopters flown by qualified pilots.",
  driving:
    "In Vietnam, we drive on the right side.<br/>An international Driving license is not valid. Only owners of a Vietnamese driving license are allowed to drive a car or a motorcycle.<br/>Without talking about insurance matters, renting a motorbike is possible although not recommended due to the dense traffic in main cities such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City",

Meals are generally not spicy but make use of a wide array of interesting sauces.

Beyond the delights of the street stalls and culinary wonders of Vietnam, main cities now offer an increasing selection of international restaurants.",
  shopping:
    "All sorts of goods and manufactured products can be found. From high-tech products to local handicraft products (lacquer ware, painting, silk, wood and stone art works…), main cities have an abundance of small shops and even big shopping centers. Those who plan to bring back souvenirs are therefore advised to travel light. Prices displayed are usually fixed, but in other cases, bargaining is a fact of life in Vietnam!",
